\section{Conclusion and Future}
\label{sec_conclusion}
In this work we discussed the implementation of ZyNet, a Python package for automating deep neural network implementation on low-cost FPGA-based edge computing devices.
Results show that the implementation are capable of achieving high accuracy and clock performance with low resource utilization.
The proposed platform is capable of outperforming pure software implementation by more than 4$times$ on high-end machines and by several orders on other embedded platforms.

The main limitation of current release of ZyNet is that it supports only fully connected hidden layers.
In the future more varieties of networks will be supported on ZyNet such as CNNs and RNNs.
Other low-end platforms such as Intel Arria will be supported for automated system implementation.
The package is available in the public domain through the Python Package Index~(PyPI) repository and example designs are available through the git repository~\cite{zynetgit}.
